# Actions
> A collection of **my** "high-quality" actions for [Atlas](https://atlas.bot)

## Interface
This repository uses the following format for naming each action/snippet I publish here.
They are responsible for confusing the heck outta you. The category relies on the official
[Community Actions Repository](https://github.com/sylo-digital/community-actions). 
Each folder consists of a `README.md` and action or markdown files, depends if it's a snippet
or a functional action.

> **Format â€” `Category-[Action | Snippet]Name`**\
  **Snippets:** `Misc-ColorGenerator`\
  **Actions:** `Economy-Gamble`
